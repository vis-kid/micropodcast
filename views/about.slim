  h3.faq What is this project all about?
  p Think of it as audio knowledge bombs from distinguished designers and developers that also include newbies and beginners in the conversation. 
  
  h3.faq Is it a podcast then?
  p Sure if you think of it as a series of audio episodes then yes!
  
  h3.faq What is the focus of Between | Screens?
  p Not sure I even want to have a narrow focus. Interesting people and cool technologies between code & design around web stuff maybe? 
  
  h3.faq Why are episodes often super short?
  p Simple: I wanna save you and myself included some time and focus more on the “technical” nitty gritties. As interesting as it can be, expect less industry insider chit chat from this format. Also I want to make it easy for you to skip parts of an interview you don’t care about and to fine-tune what you want to listen to. 
  
  h3.faq Why do you sometimes discuss super basic stuff?
  p I see two reasons: First of all, basic concepts can sometimes become very interesting if you dive deep enough. Secondly, we all know how easy it is to forget that “basic stuff” can be hard for peeps starting out. Atm I feel decrypting the gobbledygooky parts for beginners / newbies is necessary for the goals I have in mind with this project.  
  
  h3.faq Listening to embedded SoundCloud tracks is not working on my mobile browser with Chrome?
  p Other people and myself included have already brought this to SoundCloud’s attention and I really don’t understand what’s taking them so long to fix a major bug like this. I’m sure this won’t be an issue for long (hopefully) and I can only recommend the obvious, namely using another mobile browser of your choice in the meantime.

  h3.faq So you have sponsors now. Are you going to sell out?
  p I might do some sponsoring or similar but I have no interest in stuffing stuff down people’s throat. Don’t worry, it seems aiming for integrity and quality is somehow integral to the way I connect neurons in my brain. 
  
  h3.faq I would like to send in my feedback?
  p I'm more than happy to receive feedback. Find a channel that suits you best and feel free to write me anytime. Feedback on design and functionality is always welcome! If you’ll find a bug, I’ll do my best to fix it. 

  h3.faq Any tips for yak shaving season?

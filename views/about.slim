  h3.faq What is this project all about?
  p Think of it as audio knowledge bombs from distinguished designers and developers that also include newbies and beginners in the conversation. 

  h3.faq Is it a podcast then?
  p Sure if you think about it as a series of audio episodes then yes!

  h3.faq Why are episodes often super short?
  p Simple: I wanna save you and myself some time and focus on the “technical” nitty gritties. As interesting as it can be, expect less industry insider chit chat from this format.

  h3.faq What is the focus of Between | Screens?
  p Not sure yet or that I even want to have a narrow focus. Interesting people and cool technologies between code & design around web stuff maybe?

  h3.faq So you have sponsors now. Are you going to sell out?
  p I might do some sponsoring or similar but I have no interest in stuffing stuff down people’s throat. Don't worry, integrity and quality are somehow integral to the way I connect neurons in my brain.
